## 🧠 SQL Equivalent (Production Thinking)

Although implemented in Python, below shows **how this would run in a data warehouse**.

### RFM Metrics

```sql
SELECT
    CustomerID,
    DATEDIFF(day, MAX(InvoiceDate), '2011-12-31') AS Recency,
    COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS Frequency,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Monetary
FROM transactions
WHERE Quantity > 0
  AND CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CustomerID;


Cohort Assignment

SELECT
    CustomerID,
    MIN(DATE_TRUNC('month', InvoiceDate)) AS CohortMonth
FROM transactions
GROUP BY CustomerID;
```

## 📊 Business Intelligence (Tableau)

The dashboard answers key business questions:

- Which cohorts retain customers best?
- How fast do customers churn?
- Which customer segments generate the most revenue?
- Where should marketing and retention teams focus?
- Which customers are at risk of churn?

## 🔍 Key Insights

**Customer Retention**
- Early cohorts show **stronger long-term retention**
- Newer cohorts drop faster → potential **acquisition quality issue**

**Revenue Behavior**
- Revenue retention is **stronger than customer retention**
- Some cohorts **increase value over time**

**Customer Segmentation**
- **Champions & Loyal Customers drive most revenue**
- Large **Hibernating segment → reactivation opportunity**
- **At Risk segment requires churn prevention**
