### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed cancellations & invalid transactions  
- Handled missing Customer IDs  
- Created Revenue metric  

### 2. RFM Calculation
- **Recency** → Days since last purchase

- **Monetary** → Total revenue per customer  

### 3. Customer Segmentation
Customers classified into:

- 🏆 Champions  
- 💎 Loyal Customers  
- ⚠️ At Risk  
- 😴 Hibernating  
- 🔁 Returning Customers  

### 4. BI Dashboard (Tableau)
Interactive dashboard includes:

- Segment Distribution  
- Revenue by Segment  
- Recency vs Monetary Behavior
